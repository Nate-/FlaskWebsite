            <p class="title"> Pinole Middle School Math Club, Asst. Coach </p>
            <p class="desc">When I was volunteering as a tutor and assistant coach for the 
            Pinole Math Club, I helped co-found a Math 24 tournament for the 
            12+ club members. During the tournament, the club members competed 
            to solve Math 24 cards, where four numbers are given and any 
            combination basic arithmetic operations to result in 24. During that 
            tournament, in the last minutes of each round, the hardest cards were 
            given that they couldnâ€™t solve in time. I decided to create this 
            solver to help quickly provide them with an answer.</p>
