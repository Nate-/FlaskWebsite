                    <p>Hi! I'm Nathaniel and this is who I am in a nutshell. I’m a problem solver, script developer and life hacking enthusiast. 
                        I believe in creating robust and efficient code to optimize the amount time and effort we spend on tasks. This way, we have 
                        more time to do things we love (aka. games!) with the people we love.</p>

            <div class="title"> Pinole Middle School Math Club, Asst. Coach </div>
            <p class="desc">When I was volunteering as a tutor and assistant coach for the 
            Pinole Math Club, I helped co-found a Math 24 tournament for the 
            12+ club members. During the tournament, the club members competed 
            to solve Math 24 cards, where four numbers are given and any 
            combination basic arithmetic operations to result in 24. During that 
            tournament, in the last minutes of each round, the hardest cards were 
            given that they couldn’t solve in time. I decided to create this 
            solver to help quickly provide them with an answer.</p>
